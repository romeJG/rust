# My Rust Journey

#### WTH is this repo
It's just my repo that documents my journey through learning the rust programming language using the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/), I will follow the book and with some help of GPT 4o for the in depth explanation or if I dont understand te explanation in the book.

Im just a web developer that's really interested in rust and I want to discover a low level programming language and yeah, I had experience with C++ and some C#. I really liked how the rusteceans are like they are really friendly in the forums and they really inspire me to create and start learning and even start my own project using Rust :)
